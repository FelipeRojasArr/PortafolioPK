            <h1>Felipe Rojas portafolio</h1>
            <p>Hey! my name is Felipe Rojas. I'm a mechatronic engineer interested in Internet of Things (IoT) services
               as well as machine learning algorithms. Througout my years in school, I had the oportunity to be working in different
               areas of my carrer. I have experience in machine design. Besides programming, one of the this that I like the most
               is 3D modeling mechanisms or parts by CAD. And this has led me to learn other applications for modeling asides 
               engineering purposes such as Blender. I enyoy learning new things, even if are not fully related to engineering.

                            <h4>Desing of a smart parking for bikes</h4>
                            <p>I'm currently collaborating with Smart City Concepts GmbH in the design and construcction of an intelligent parking device for bikes.
                                I am involved mainly on the mechanical design for the prototype, with tasks related to computer drawing,
                                finite element simulations, and new designs for mechanisms or part we may be needing.

                            <h4>Design of an AGV robot</h4>
                            <p>On the start of 2020, I had the oportunity to be part of the construcction of an Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV)
                                for SouthCo Chihuahua. They needed to find a solution to help on the delivery of pieces from inside the building.
                                During my time, I had the opportunity to learn new technologies such as indoor localization methods and collision avoidance systems
                                as well as learning and putting in practice my knowledge in project managment topics.

                            <h4>Construcction of a cartesian robot for capacitive screen tests</h4>
                            <p>On August 2019, I participated in a project with Resideo about the construccion of a cartesian robot that would test
                                capacitive screens for some products they usually work. The main task was to automatized the movement that 
                                test staff usually do.
                                My tasks on this project varied, but I took part on the embbeded programmer team, as well as the electrical team. 
                                During this project was where I consider I took a big step in my engineering experience.

                            <h4>Research project about thermal inversion in Chihuahua</h4>
                            <p>On my first year of college, I was invited to participate in a research of thermal inversion phenomenon present
                                in Chihuahua. The research was leaded by Cimav. Altough the main objective was to analyse and get data for future
                                researchs, with the data we were collecting we made a new branch in the project by starting to publish information
                                to the public to warn them about possible danger when the effect was strong enough. Since this phenomenon has a high
                                correlation with pollution, people doing activities outside on early hours of the morning (especially activities outdoors)
                                could be in risk of damaging internal organs due pollution gases retained. By publishing information, we could alert
                                people to take some cautions.

                <h3>More about me</h3>
                <p>Not everything about me is related to engineering. I like to learn new things. I enjoy to play music on my guitar. I love playing
                    sweet and bitter melodies on piano. I had the opportunity to learn some softwares related to image design and animations and I loved it 
                    (I even was able to use in some engineering projects).

                    So learning new things is something I always look forward.
